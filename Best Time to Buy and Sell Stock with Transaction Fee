Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int profit=0,hold=INT_MIN;
        for(int p:prices){
            profit=max(profit,hold+p);
            hold=max(hold,profit-p-fee);
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
